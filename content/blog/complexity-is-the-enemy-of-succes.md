Complexity is the enemy of success, but simplicity is its ally. The difference between the two lies in their Latin roots - "complexus" means "twisted together," while "simplicis" means "uncompounded." At Outline Solutions, we believe that simplicity is the key to success, which is why we strive to eliminate complexity in everything we do.

## What is Complexity?

Complexity can be defined as the state of being difficult to understand or deal with. It can arise from a variety of sources, such as too many moving parts, unclear goals, or a lack of communication. Complexity can lead to confusion, mistakes, delays, and ultimately, failure. It's important to recognize complexity early on in a project and work to address it.

## Why is Complexity the Enemy?

Complexity can have many negative effects on a project. Firstly, it can lead to delays and mistakes, which can cause a project to go over budget and fail to meet its goals. It can also cause confusion among team members, making it difficult to coordinate and communicate effectively. Additionally, complexity can lead to frustration and burnout among team members, which can ultimately lead to turnover and lower productivity.

## How We Combat Complexity

At Outline Solutions, we believe that simplicity is key to success. We work to eliminate complexity whenever possible by taking a streamlined approach to our projects.

One of the ways we achieve this is by focusing on the core needs of our clients, avoiding unnecessary details or features that don't add value. For example we follow a standardized approach to design, allowing us to focus on bringing value to our clients' unique needs faster and more affordably.

Another way we reduce complexity is through our fixed cost fixed timeline approach. By setting clear deadlines and budgets from the outset of a project, we're able to eliminate unnecessary back-and-forth communication and keep the project on track. This approach allows us to work more efficiently and deliver high-quality work faster.

We also work together alone, using one-man teams to ensure that each individual has expertise in multiple areas. This approach allows us to provide personalized attention and efficient communication to our clients, without the need for extensive coordination between team members.

## Conclusion

At Outline Solutions, we believe that complexity is the enemy of success, which is why we strive to simplify everything we do. By being transparent with our clients, using a fixed cost fixed timeline approach, and working in one-man teams, we're able to eliminate unnecessary complexity and deliver high-quality work that meets the unique needs of each of our clients.
